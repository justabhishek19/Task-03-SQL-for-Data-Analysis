* **sales** – transaction details (invoice number, category, quantity, price, shopping mall)

Null values were cleaned in Excel before importing the data.

## Tools Used

* SQLite
* SQL
* Excel (for data cleaning)

## SQL Analysis Performed

The project includes queries for:

* Total customers and total sales transactions
* Total revenue calculation
* Revenue by category and shopping mall
* Revenue by gender and payment method
* Join operations between tables
* Subqueries for above-average transactions
* Outlier detection based on age
* Top 5 highest value transactions
* Creating views for analysis
* Indexing for performance optimization
